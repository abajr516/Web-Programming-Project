I am a senior computer science major at Adelphi University with a concentration on software engineering and information security. I am in the honors program and the 4+1 program at Adelphi. I am adept at team collaboration and submitting deliverables in a timely manner. My contributions toward this project were adding functionality and dynamic behavior to the webpages. I had a significant impact on our core services: the budget calculator and the cashflow calculator. </p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sabawoon Popal:</p><p>Hello, my name is Sabawoon Popal. I am currently a senior Computer Science
                student at Adelphi University, with tracks (major focus) on Software Engineering, and Information Security.
                I emphasize project collaboration using Agile development methodologies, and the strengths that I have to
                contribute to group projects and software development include Java, web development tools (HTML, PHP, CSS,
                full-stack, ability to use XAMPP). I advocate for efficient programs and runtime, which is why simply writing
                code is not enough for me, as I look forward to utilizing my knowledge in algorithms and time-complexity to
                optimize the performance and speed of software systems. I am team-oriented and have no problem helping my teammates
                who are stuck with a phase in coding, development, testing, or debugging. My contributions toward this project was establishing and
                implementing the style and layout of the webpages, along with both cosmetic and crucial design decisions that influenced webpage UI.</p>
